## 🎯 Key Things to Verify

### ✅ Server Console Should Show:

- 📢 All notification broadcasts
- ✅ Successful notification deliveries
- 📊 Count of clients/subscribers notified
- 🚫 Content filtering in action
- 🔄 All incoming requests

### ✅ Client Consoles Should Show:

- 📨 Notification reception confirmations
- 🆕 New channel notifications (ALL clients)
- 🗑️ Channel deletion notifications (ALL clients)
- 📰 News notifications (ONLY subscribers)
- 🔔 Notification system startup

### ✅ Verification Points:

1. **Global Notifications**: Channel creation/deletion notifies ALL connected clients
2. **Subscriber-Only Notifications**: News only goes to subscribers
3. **Content Filtering**: Forbidden words block news publication
4. **No Notifications**: Unsubscribed clients don't receive news
5. **Console Logging**: Clear visibility of all notification activity

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

**Terminal 1 (Server):**

```bash
python server.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Alice):**

```
register alice pass123
login alice pass123
create_channel "Test Channel" "Testing notifications"
publish_news "Test Channel" This is a test message
```

**Terminal 3 (Bob):**

```
register bob pass456
login bob pass456
subscribe "Test Channel"
```

Watch the server console for notification logs and Bob's console for received notifications!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If notifications aren't working:

1. Check that notification ports are shown in client startup
2. Verify server shows "Total clients notified" > 0
3. Ensure clients show "📨 NOTIFICATION RECEIVED" messages
4. Try restarting clients if notification thread fails

The enhanced system now provides complete visibility into the notification process! 🎉
